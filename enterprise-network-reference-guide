Enterprise Network Reference Guide

1. Title & Purpose

- This reference guide documents the architecture, configuration, and maintenance of a Linux-centered enterprise network running on virtualized infrastructure.  It serves as both a 
  technical manual for ongoing operations and a blueprint for scaling the environment. Performing the steps in this guide will allow me to perform the functions of a 
  Linux Administrator. In step-by-step detail, the actions in this guide will serve as a future point for memorization.

2. Scope of This Guide
Designed for a small-scale enterprise simulation with services modeled after large organizations.
Optimized for Linux-based servers with open-source and self-hosted solutions.
Supports integration of VoIP, security cameras, CI/CD pipelines, and core business services.
Intended for internal IT staff, network administrators, and systems engineers.

3. Current Network Layout & Hardware
(Insert your existing network diagram or a text-based topology overview here.)

Primary Host Hardware:

AMD Ryzen 7 7700X (8 cores, 16 threads, 4.5 GHz)
64 GB DDR5 RAM
2 TB NVMe SSD (Primary Storage)
Virtualization Platform: KVM/QEMU + VirtualBox (testing)
Planned Server Roles:

Directory Services & Authentication (LDAP/FreeIPA)
DNS/DHCP Server
Email Server
Client Application Server
Production Application Server
VoIP Server
Security Camera NVR Server
Web Server (internal/external)
Database Server
Monitoring & Logging Server
File Server (SMB/NFS)
Repository & CI/CD Server
Backup Server
4. Services & VM Roles
Example:
DNS/DHCP Server

OS: RHEL 9
Services: bind, dhcpd
Hardware Allocation: 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 20 GB storage
Notes: Serves internal network addressing and name resolution.
(Repeat for each server role with specs.)

5. Configuration & Deployment Steps
Step-by-step setup for each service
VM provisioning commands
Network configuration (bridging, VLANs, firewall rules)

6. Maintenance & Monitoring Procedures
Regular update schedule (dnf upgrade)
Log review process
Backup verification steps
Monitoring alerts setup

7. Future Expansion Plans
Migrate to full Proxmox or VMware vSphere cluster
Scale to multi-node Kubernetes for container workloads
Add additional storage via NAS/SAN integration
Expand monitoring into SIEM solution

Bash - scripting language



OpenStack - OpenStack is a free, open-source cloud computing platform that provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in both public and private clouds. It was initially developed by Rackspace Hosting and NASA in 2010. OpenStack allows users to manage and provision virtual resources such as compute, storage, and networking through a web-based dashboard, command-line tools, or RESTful web services.



OpenShift - OpenShift is a containerization platform developed by Red Hat. It is an open-supply platform that allows builders to build, install, and scale packages in packing containers. Containers are small, portable, and persistent environments that package together the utility and its dependencies.



AWS - 
	- eks: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the operation and maintenance of 			Kubernetes clusters in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and on-premises data centers. Kubernetes is an open-source system that automates 		the management,	scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.
	- ec2: Amazon EC2 is one of the most widely-used services offered by Amazon. It hosts configurable virtual machines in the AWS cloud, 			which can be configured individually to suit the end user’s needs. The service allows users to configure a computer with the 			required amount of CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage, and be able to access it within minutes.

		This service allows companies to quickly and easily scale their operations up or down, depending on their computing requirements. 		New systems can be provisioned, configured, and deployed in a matter of minutes. This flexible architecture of EC2 has made it the 		go-to option for many companies.

		Amazon EC2 also has a variety of features that allows it to function better in conjunction with other AWS services. This includes 		integrations with Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon VPC, along with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. EC2 Auto Scaling automatically 			increases or decreases the number of required EC2 instances depending on the load.

		Amazon EC2 is also more cost-effective than setting up an on-premise solution, as virtual machines (VMs) can be requested from the 		lowest level of load and scaled up as the demand increases. There is no need to invest money upfront, as with building an on-			premises computing solution.
	- rds: Amazon RDS is used for building a relational database service in the cloud. Just like other AWS products, Amazon RDS also allows 		the provisioning of large amounts of storage in an accessible format.

		Relational databases are an easy way to store and index large amounts of data, thus making it the go-to option for large 			companies. Overall, Amazon RDS offers a way to quickly and dependably create a relational database in the cloud. This, in turn, 		allows easy backup and redundancy measures for private data.

		Under the umbrella of RDS, AWS provides various configurations of hardware and software depending on the use-case. These 			configurations stand as services on their own and are optimized for memory, performance, or input/output speed. These include 			Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.

		RDS provides many benefits over on-premises databanks, such as improved security through isolation. Moreover, it is also easy to 		provision a database through a command-line interface, with a variety of options regarding storage type. As with other AWS 			services, RDS can also be scaled up or down depending on the user load on the system.

		Customers can choose between two different types of storage, both backed by high-speed storage mediums known as solid-state 			drives. While one is optimized for high-performance applications that require a lot of input and output, the other is a slower 			medium for cost-effective general use.
	- s3: Storage was one of the first infrastructural options offered over the cloud and remains one of AWS’ most used services to date. It 		is worth noting that S3 is different from Amazon RDS, as the latter is a way to create a database, while the former simply stores 		all kinds of objects.

		S3 allows users to store any form of information on AWS servers, which can then be accessed from any computer with the required 		credentials. There are various classes of storage available, ranging from extremely cost-efficient options to high-performance, 		high-speed storage mediums.

		The service also provides many optimizations and cost-savings tools, such as S3 Storage Class Analysis. This tool computes the 			access patterns of the data saved on the cloud and suggests the most cost-effective and usable alternative for that specific 			pattern. It also includes a feature called S3 Intelligent-Tiering, which observes data access patterns and tiers objects 			automatically.

		The service also provides security and durability of data through duplication. Every time data is uploaded to AWS S3, it is copied 		and stored in geographically distinct locations. This provides security through redundancy, allowing companies to retrieve 			important data at any time.

LDAP - LDAP, or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is a protocol used to access and manage directory information over a network. It allows applications to query and modify user-related data, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, and printer connections, stored in a directory. This protocol is widely used for authentication and directory services in IT systems.

LDAP is vendor-neutral, meaning it can work with various directory services, including Microsoft Active Directory and open-source solutions. It acts as a "language" that applications use to interact with directories, enabling quick and efficient data retrieval.



Kerberos - Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that uses tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.  Kerberos is primarily aimed at a client-server model and provides mutual authentication, meaning both the user and the server verify each other's identity



TLS Certificates - TLS certificates are digital files issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). They serve as a means to verify the identity of a server or website and establish a secure, encrypted connection between a client (e.g., a browser) and a server. Here's how they are used:
Authentication: During the TLS handshake, the server presents its TLS certificate to the client. This certificate contains the server's public key and is signed by a trusted CA. The client verifies the certificate to ensure it is valid and issued by a trusted authority.
Encryption: The certificate includes the server's public key, which the client uses to encrypt a session key. This session key is then used for symmetric encryption during the communication. This ensures that data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted and secure.
Data Integrity: TLS certificates also ensure that the data transmitted has not been tampered with during transit. This is achieved using cryptographic techniques like digital signatures.

# Network Lab Documentation

Welcome to the Network Lab documentation repository. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and organized reference for all aspects of the network lab environment, including hardware setup, software installation, management practices, security hardening, and troubleshooting.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to simulate real-world enterprise network environments to:

- Develop hands-on skills with network hardware and software.
- Understand best practices for network management and security.
- Document detailed procedures and configurations for reproducibility.
- Serve as a portfolio to showcase networking and systems administration expertise.

## Directory Structure and Contents

### hardware/

This directory contains detailed documentation on the physical network infrastructure, including:

- **Switches**: Models, initial setup, VLAN configuration, and management access.
- **Routers**: Routing protocols used, interface configurations, and firmware updates.
- **Firewalls**: Installation, rule sets, and VPN setups.
- **IP Cameras & IoT Devices**: Configuration, integration, and security considerations.
- **Cabling & Rack Setup**: Physical wiring diagrams, labeling schemes, and rack layouts.

*Example:*  
`hardware/catalyst-2960-setup.md` — Step-by-step guide to configure Cisco Catalyst 2960 switches for segmented VLAN architecture.

---

### software/

This folder documents software tools and services used within the lab, such as:

- Network monitoring tools (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix).
- Automation/orchestration tools (e.g., Ansible, n8n workflows).
- Firewall software and IDS/IPS (e.g., pfSense, Suricata).
- VPN clients and servers setup.
- Utilities for packet analysis (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump).

*Example:*  
`software/n8n-automation.md` — Instructions to deploy and configure n8n workflow automation on the lab network.

---

### management/

Focuses on ongoing operational tasks including:

- User and permission management for network device access.
- Firmware and software update policies.
- Backup and restore procedures for device configurations.
- Network documentation standards (e.g., IP addressing schemes, naming conventions).
- Scheduled maintenance and auditing checklists.

*Example:*  
`management/backup-procedures.md` — Automated backups of network device configurations using scripts and cron jobs.

---

### troubleshooting/

Provides systematic approaches to diagnose and fix common network problems:

- Connectivity issues.
- Performance bottlenecks.
- Security incident response.
- Log file analysis and event correlation.
- Tools and commands cheat sheet.

*Example:*  
`troubleshooting/vlan-connectivity-issues.md` — Stepwise guide to identify and resolve VLAN misconfigurations.

---

### security/

Dedicated to securing the network lab environment, covering:

- Network hardening techniques and best practices.
- Firewall and ACL configurations.
- IDS/IPS deployment and tuning.
- Secure management protocols (SSH keys, two-factor authentication).
- Incident detection and response plans.

*Example:*  
`security/firewall-rule-management.md` — Best practices for creating and managing firewall rules to minimize attack surfaces.

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the **hardware/** directory to understand the physical layout and device configurations.
2. Proceed to **software/** to set up and integrate network management and automation tools.
3. Use **management/** documentation to maintain the network’s health and consistency.
4. Refer to **security/** guidelines early and continuously to protect the environment.
5. Consult **troubleshooting/** when issues arise.
